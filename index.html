									<h1 class="major">What is Photography
							
									<br />
									</h1>
									<p> As a typical public art, photography has taken an essential part in delivering messages. For example, photography is crucial for the news reporting not only the paper newsies such as many different newspapers but also the online reports such as various social media or different official web site for the news reports. On the other hand, photography is not only usually recognized as an essential art that for people to get their visual enjoyment and enrich people's inner world but also known as a pretty good art for the photographers to show how do they feel, think and believe to their audience. Photography is an exciting but challenging art because the knowledge of photography is too costly and fast-developing for people to learn them all. For example, there are different light positioning, composition technologies along with unlimited creative ways of creating a single photograph such as light painting, long exposure, and many other things. Because of this, the topic of this web site is going to be introducing the definition of photography, it is meanly about the basic knowledge of what is photography and introduce many parts of the photography art such as landscape photography and portrait photography and what are they along with some knowledge about how it works.

									<p>The method for me to show the knowledge of photography on this web site is that I am going to use different sections that can change the small images to the large image by left-clicking the mouse. The small image shows first, which illustrates the names of the technologies and the large image shows after the small image demonstrates the details of definition and how to use the techniques. </p>

									<h2 class="major">landscape photography</h2>
									<p>Landscape photography is a massive area of photography art. It is usually an outdoor activity because it is generally focusing on the natural environment more. According to Photography Life, "Landscape photography is the art of capturing pictures of nature and the outdoors in a way that brings your viewer into the scene.” (Photography Life, n.d.) This shows that for the definition of landscape photography, this is like a way that people are recording the outdoor world by taking photos. Landscape photography could also be divided into different parts—for example, Astrophotography, Normal landscape photography, Microphotography, construction photography and seascape photography.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Portrait photography</h2>
									<p>Portrait photography is a kind of flexible category in photography art, which means it could be either outdoor or indoor activity; the only difference between outdoor and indoor activities is that. Doing portrait photography at the outdoors can quickly get endless exciting backgrounds, but difficult to control the lights. However, to do portrait photography in the studio can adjust the shine very quickly. This is a kind of photography that focuses on people, not the outdoor environment. According to Nate Torres ” Portrait photography is about capturing the essence, personality, identity and attitude of a person utilizing backgrounds, lighting and posing.” (Torres N, n.d.) It shows that portrait photography is a kind of art that was looking for background and making light environment for people, not a natural environment.  </p>
